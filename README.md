An Experiment to Implement DataFlow - a unified Stream and Batch Processing system

This Experiment is meant to implement DataFlow Model, as per descibed here: www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf, with the 
aim to implement Unified Stream + Batch Processing model as an alternative to Lambda Architecture.
